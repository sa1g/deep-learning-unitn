[Baseline model](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/resources/resnet_50_v1_5_for_pytorch) taken from NVidia's implementation of The ResNet50 v1.5 model which is a modified version of the original ResNet50 v1 model.

This model was created in 2015. Our objective is to perform TTA on Resnet-A and ImageNet-V2, which were published in 2019 and 2021, so their data was surely not in the original training data.
